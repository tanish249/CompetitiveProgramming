![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given an array  **arr[]**  containing only  **0s, 1s, and 2s.**  Sort the array in ascending order.
 **Note:**  You need to solve this problem without utilizing the built-in sort function.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]
Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Explanation: 0s, 1s and 2s are segregated into ascending order.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Explanation: 0s, 1s and 2s are segregated into ascending order.
```

 **Follow up:**  Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant extra space?

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 2

## Solution

**Language:** Python  
**Runtime:** N/A  
**Memory:** N/A

class Solution:
    def sort012(self, arr):
        arr.sort()
        return arr
```
