# The If Statement

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

Given a number **n**, use the if statement to print " **Big** " (without quotes) if the given number is greater than 100. The statement " **Number** " (without quotes) will be printed regardless.

 **Note:** Follow Sample cases for the output format. After printing move the cursor to the next line.

 **Examples :** 

```
Input: n = 10
Output: 
Number
Explanation: 10 is less than 100, so we don't print Big and Number will be printed by default.

```

```
Input: n = 101
Output:
Big
Number
Explanation: 101 is greater than 100, so we print Big and Number will be printed by default in the next line.
```
