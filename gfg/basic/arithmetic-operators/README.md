## Problem

Given two integer variables x and y, perform the following operations:

- p: Addition of x and y
- q: Subtraction of y from x
- r: Multiplication of x and y
- s: Floating-point division of x by y
- t: Integer division of x by y
- u: Modulo (remainder when x is divided by y)

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: x = 1, y = 2
Output: 3 -1 2 0.500 0 1
Explanation: The given operations are performed:
Addition of x and y = 3
Subtraction of y from x = -1
Multiplication of x and y = 2
Floating-point division of x by y = 0.500
Integer division of x by y = 0
Modulo of x and y = 1
Hence, the output is 3 -1 2 0.500 0 1.

```

```
Input: x = 3,y = 4 
Output: 7 -1 12 0.750 0 3
Explanation: The given operations are performed.
```

```py
x = int(input())
y = int(input())
p=x+y
q=x-y
r=x*y
s=x/y
t=x//y
u=x%y
print(p, q, r, f"{s:.3f}", t, u)
```
