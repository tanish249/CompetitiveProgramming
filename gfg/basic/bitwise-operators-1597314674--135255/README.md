# Bitwise Operators

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

Given three positive integers  **a**,  **b**  and  **c**. Perform some bitwise operations on them as given below:
 **1.**  d = a ^ a
 **2.** e = c ^ b
 **3.**  f = a & b
 **4.**  g = ~ e
 **Note: ^** is for xor.
Then print d e f g space seperately. Move the cursor to the next line after printing.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
Output: 0 1 0 -2
Explanation: We print d e f g after performing the given operations.
```

```
Input: a = 4, b = 5, c = 6
Output: 0 3 4 -4
Explanation: We print d e f g after performing the given operations.
```

```py
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
q=a^a
w=c^b
e=a&b
r=~w
print(q,w,e,r)
```
