# Array Search

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

Given an array,  **arr[]**  of n integers, and an integer element  **x**, find whether element x is present in the array. Return the index of the first occurrence of x in the array, or -1 if it doesn't exist.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4], x = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: For array [1, 2, 3, 4], the element to be searched is 3. Since 3 is present at index 2, the output is 2.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [10, 8, 30, 4, 5], x = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: For array [10, 8, 30, 4, 5], the element to be searched is 5 and it is at index 4. So, the output is 4.

```

```
Input: arr[] = [10, 8, 30], x = 6
Output: -1
Explanation: The element to be searched is 6 and it is not present, so we return -1.
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ arr.size ≤ 106
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106
0 ≤ x ≤ 105

class Solution:
    def search(self, arr, x):
        if x in arr:
            return (arr.index(x))
        else:
            return -1
```
