![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

Given three integers  **p**,  **r** and  **t**, denoting Principal, Rate of Interest and Time period respectively. Calculate and print the Simple Interest.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: p = 100, r = 20, t = 2
Output: 40.00
Explanation: The simple interest on 100 at a rate of 20% across 2 time periods is 40.
```

```
Input: p = 999, r = 9, t = 9
Output: 809.19
Explanation: The simple interest on 999 at a rate of 9% across 9 time periods is 809.19
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ p ≤ 105
1 ≤ r, t ≤ 100
