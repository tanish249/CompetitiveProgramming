# Prime Number

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a number  **n**, determine whether it is a  **prime number**  or not.
 **Note:**  A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

**Examples :
**

```
Input: n = 7
Output: true
Explanation: 7 has exactly two divisors: 1 and 7, making it a prime number.
```

```
Input: n = 25
Output: false
Explanation: 25 has more than two divisors: 1, 5, and 25, so it is not a prime number.
```

```
Input: n = 1
Output: false
Explanation: 1 has only one divisor (1 itself), which is not sufficient for it to be considered prime.
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ n ≤ 109

## Solution

    def isPrime(self, n):
        if n<2:
            return False
        else:
            for i in range(2,n):
                if n%i==0:
                    return False
                    break
            else:
                return True
```
