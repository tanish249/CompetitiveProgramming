# Intersection of Two Sorted Arrays

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given two sorted arrays  **arr1** [] and  **arr** 2[]. Your task is to return the  **intersection** of both arrays.
Intersection of two arrays is said to be elements that are common in both arrays. The intersection should not count duplicate elements.
Note: If there is no intersection then return an empty array.

 **Examples**  **:** 

```
Input: arr1[] = [1, 2, 3, 4], arr2[] = [2, 4, 6, 7, 8]
Output: [2, 4]
Explanation: 2 and 4 are only common elements in both the arrays.
```

```
Input: arr1[] = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4], arr2[] = [2, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8]
Output: [2, 4]
Explanation: 2 and 4 are the only common elements.
```

```
Input: arr1[] = [1, 2], arr2[] = [3, 4]
Output: []
Explanation: No common elements.
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ arr1.size(),arr2.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr1[i], arr2[i] ≤ 106

```py
class Solution:
    def intersection(self, arr1, arr2):
        h=set(arr1)
        g=set(arr2)
        common=[]
        
        for i in g:
            if i in h:
                common.append(i)
        common.sort()
        return common
    

```
