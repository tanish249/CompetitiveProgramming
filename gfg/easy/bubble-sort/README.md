# Bubble Sort

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an array,  **arr[]**. Sort the array using bubble sort algorithm.

**Examples :
**

```
Input: arr[] = [4, 1, 3, 9, 7]
Output: [1, 3, 4, 7, 9]
Explanation: After Sorting the array in ascending order of their values is [1, 3, 4, 7, 9].
```

```
Input: arr[] = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Explanation: Sort the array in ascending order of their values.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Explanation: An array that is already sorted should remain unchanged after applying bubble sort.
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 103
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 103

```py
class Solution:
    def bubbleSort(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n - i - 1):
                if nums[j] > nums[j + 1]:
                    nums[j], nums[j + 1] = nums[j + 1], nums[j]

        return nums
```
