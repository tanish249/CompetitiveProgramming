## Problem

Given a number  **n,**  print your answer according to the following conditions:

- If the number is divisible by 3, you print Fizz
- If the number is divisible by 5, you print Buzz
- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, you print FizzBuzz
- In any other case, you print the number itself

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: n = 3
Output: Fizz
Explanation: Here, the number is divisible by 3, so Fizz is printed.
```

```
Input: n = 5

Explanation: Here the number is divisible by 5, so Buzz is printed.
```

```
Input: number = 15
Output: FizzBuzz
Explanation: Here, the number 15 is divisible by both 3 and 5, so FizzBuzz is printed.

```

```
Input: number = 7
Output: 7
