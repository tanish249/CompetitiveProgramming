## Problem

### Chef and Spells

Chef has three spells. Their powers are $A$, $B$, and $C$ respectively. Initially, Chef has $0$ hit points, and if he uses a spell with power $P$, then his number of hit points increases by $P$.

Before going to sleep, Chef wants to use exactly two spells out of these three. Find the maximum number of hit points Chef can have after using the spells.

### Input Format
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $A$, $B$, and $C$.
### Output Format

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the maximum number of hit points.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^4$
- $1 \leq A, B, C \leq 10^8$
### Subtasks

 **Subtask #1 (100 points):**  original constraints

### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
2
4 2 8
10 14 18
```

```
12
32
```

### Explanation:

 **Example case 1:**  Chef has three possible options:

- Use the first and second spell and have $4 + 2 = 6$ hitpoints.
- Use the second and third spell and have $2 + 8 = 10$ hitpoints.
- Use the first and third spell and have $4 + 8 = 12$ hitpoints.

Chef should choose the third option and use the spells with power $4$ and $8$ to have $12$ hitpoints.

 **Example case 2:**  Chef should use the spells with power $14$ and $18$.

```py
t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    nums=list(map(int,input().split()))
    h=nums[-1]+nums[-2]
    print(h)
```
