## Problem

### Chef Fantasy 11

All of Chef's friends are playing fantasy cricket based upon the ODI World Cup, and Chef would like to join them.

For a certain cricket match, Chef has decided upon his team of $11$ players. However, he hasn't yet decided who should be the captain and who should be the vice-captain.

He's narrowed his decision down to $N$ players out of the $11$, from which he'll choose one to be the captain and one to be the vice captain.
How many different choices does he have?

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- The first and the only line of each testcase contains a single integer $N$, the number of players Chef is considering.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the number of possible choices of captain and vice-captain.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $2 \leq N \leq 11$
