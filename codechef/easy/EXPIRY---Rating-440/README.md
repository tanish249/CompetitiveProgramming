## Problem

### Expiring Bread

Eikooc loves bread. She has $N$ loaves of bread, all of which expire after exactly $M$ days. She can eat upto $K$ loaves of bread in a day. Can she eat all the loaves of bread before they expire?

### Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer $T$ - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- Each test case consists of a single line containing three integers $N$, $M$ and $K$ - the number of loaves of bread Eikooc has, the number of days after which all the breads will expire and the number of loaves of bread Eikooc can eat in a day.
### Output Format

For each test case, output `Yes` if it will be possible for Eikooc to eat all the loaves of bread before they expire. Otherwise output `No`.

You may print each character of `Yes` and `No` in uppercase or lowercase (for example, `yes`, `yEs`, `YES` will be considered identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \le N, M, K \le 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
100 100 1
9 2 5
19 6 3

```

```
Yes
Yes
No

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case 1:**  Eikooc can eat one loaf of bread per day for $100$ days. Thus none of the bread expires.

 **Test case 2:**  Eikooc can eat $5$ loaves of the first day and $4$ loaves on the second day. Thus none of the bread expires.

 **Test case 3:**  There is no way Eikooc can consume all the loaves of bread before it expires.

```py
t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a,b,c=map(int,input().split())
    h=b*c
    if(a==h):
        print("YES")
    elif(h>a):
        print("YES")
    elif(a>h):
        print("NO")
```
