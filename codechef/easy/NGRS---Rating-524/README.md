## Problem

### 50-50 Rule

Schools of Chefland use the $50-50$ rule to grade their students. As per the rule, students are awarded :

- Z grade, if their attendance is strictly less than $50\%$.
- F grade, if they score strictly less than $50\%$ marks, given that their attendance is greater than or equal to $50\%$.
- A grade, otherwise.

You are given two integers, $X$ and $Y$, denoting the percentage of attendance and percentage of marks obtained by Alice. What grade will Alice get?

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of two space-separated integers $X$ and $Y$ — the percentage of attendance and percentage of marks obtained by Alice.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line, the grade awarded to Alice.

Note that you may print the grade in lowercase or uppercase.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^4$
- $1 \leq X, Y \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
49 100
49 49
50 49
50 50

```

```
Z
Z
F
A

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Alice's attendance is less than $50\%$ so she will be awarded `Z` grade.

 **Test case $3$:**  Alice's attendance is equal to $50\%$ and her marks are less than $50\%$, so she will be awarded `F` grade.

 **Test case $4$:**  Alice's attendance is equal to $50\%$ and her marks are also equal to $50\%$, so she will be awarded `A` grade.

```py
t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a,b=map(int,input().split())
    h= (a/100)*100
    k= (b/100)*100
    if(h<50):
        print("Z")
    elif(h>=50 and k<50):
        print("F")
    else:
        print("A")
```
