## Problem

### Best of Two

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Each player rolls a standard six-sided die three times. The score of a player is calculated as the sum of the two highest rolls. The player with the higher score wins. If both players have the same score, the game ends in a tie.

Determine the winner of the game or if it is a tie.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case contains six space-separated integers $A_1$, $A_2$, $A_3$, $B_1$, $B_2$ and $B_3$ — the values Alice gets in her $3$ dice rolls, followed by the values which Bob gets in his $3$ dice rolls.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line `Alice` if Alice wins, `Bob` if Bob wins and `Tie` in case of a tie.

Note that you may print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings `tie`, `TIE`, `Tie`, and `tIe` are considered identical.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^4$
- $1 \leq A_1, A_2, A_3, B_1, B_2, B_3 \leq 6$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
3 2 5 6 1 1
4 4 5 6 4 1
6 6 6 6 6 1

```

```
Alice
Bob
Tie
```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case $1$:**  Alice's score is $8 = (3 + 5)$ which is greater than Bob's score $7 = (6 + 1)$.

 **Test Case $2$:**  Alice's score is $9 = (5 + 4)$ which is less than Bob's score $10 = (6 + 4)$.

 **Test Case $3$:**  Alice's score is $12 = (6 + 6)$ which is same as Bob's score $12 = (6 + 6)$.

```py
t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a,b,c,d,e,f=list(map(int,input().split()))
    num1=[a,b,c]
    num1.sort()
    h=num1[1]+num1[2]
    num2=[f,d,e]
    num2.sort()
    g=num2[1]+num2[2]
    if h>g:
        print('ALICE')
    elif g>h:
        print("BOB")
    else:
        print("TIE")
```
