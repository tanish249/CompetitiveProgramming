## Problem

### Sort the String

You have a  **binary**  string $S$ of length $N$. In one operation you can select a substring of $S$ and  **reverse**  it. For example, on reversing the substring $S[2,4]$ for $S=11000$, we change $1 \textcolor{red}{100} 0 \rightarrow 1 \textcolor{red}{001} 0$.

Find the  **minimum**  number of operations required to sort this binary string.
It can be proven that the string can always be sorted using the above operation finite number of times.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of $2$ lines of input. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$ — the length of the binary string. The second line of each test case contains a binary string $S$ of length $N$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line — the minimum number of operations required to sort the binary string.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 2\cdot 10^5$
- $1 \leq N \leq 2\cdot 10^5$
- Sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$.
- String $S$ consists of only '$0$'s and '$1$'s.
### Sample 1:

Output

```
4

000
4
1001
4
1010
6
010101
```

```
0
1
2
2
```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  The string is already sorted, hence, zero operations are required to sort it.

 **Test case $2$:**  We can sort the string in the following way: $\textcolor{red}{100} 1$ $\rightarrow$ $0011$.

 **Test case $3$:**  We can sort the string in the following way:
$1 \textcolor{red}{01} 0$ $\rightarrow$ $\textcolor{red}{1100}$ $\rightarrow$ $0011$.
It can be proven that this string cannot be sorted in less than $2$ operations.

 **Test case $4$:**  We can sort the string in the following way:
$0 \textcolor{red}{1010}1$ $\rightarrow$ $00 \textcolor{red}{10}11$ $\rightarrow$ $000111$.
It can be proven that this string cannot be sorted in less than $2$ operations.

```py
t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    x=int(input())
    a=input()
    h=a.count("1")
    g=int(a[-1])
    print(abs(h-g))
```
