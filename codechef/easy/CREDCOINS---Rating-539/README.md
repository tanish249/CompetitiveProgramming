## Problem

### CRED Coins

For each bill you pay using CRED, you earn $X$ CRED coins.
At CodeChef store, each bag is worth $100$ CRED coins.

Chef pays $Y$ number of bills using CRED. Find the  **maximum**  number of bags he can get from the CodeChef store.

### Input Format
- First line will contain $T$, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- Each test case contains of a single line of input, two integers $X$ and $Y$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output in a single line - the  **maximum**  number of bags Chef can get from the CodeChef store.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq X,Y \leq 1000$
### Subtasks
- Subtask 1 (100 points): Original constraints.
### Sample 1:

Output

```

10 10
20 4
70 7
```

```

0
4
```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case $1$:**  For each bill payment, one receives $10$ CRED coins. Chef pays $10$ bills using CRED. Thus, he receives $100$ CRED coins. Chef can get $1$ bag from the CodeChef store using these coins.

 **Test Case $2$:**  For each bill payment, one receives $20$ CRED coins. Chef pays $4$ bills using CRED. Thus, he receives $80$ CRED coins. Chef cannot get any bag from the CodeChef store using these coins.

 **Test Case $3$:**  For each bill payment, one receives $70$ CRED coins. Chef pays $7$ bills using CRED. Thus, he receives $490$ CRED coins. Chef can get at most $4$ bags from the CodeChef store using these coins.

```py
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    h = a * b

    if h >= 100:
        print(int(h / 100))
    else:
        print(0)
```
