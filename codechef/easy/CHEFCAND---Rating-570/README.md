## Problem

### Chef and Candies

There are $N$ children and Chef wants to give them $1$ candy each. Chef already has $X$ candies with him. To buy the rest, he visits a candy shop. In the shop, packets containing  **exactly**  $4$ candies are available.

Determine the  **minimum**  number of candy packets Chef must buy so that he is able to give $1$ candy to each of the $N$ children.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two integers $N$ and $X$ — the number of children and the number of candies Chef already has.
### Output Format

For each test case, output the  **minimum**  number of candy packets Chef must buy so that he is able to give $1$ candy to each of the $N$ children.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq N, X \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
20 12
10 100
10 9
20 9

```

```
2
0
1
3

```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case $1$:**  Chef must buy $2$ more packets after which he will have $20$ candies which will be enough to distribute $1$ candy to each of the $20$ children.

 **Test Case $2$:**  Chef does not need to buy more packets since he already has $100$ candies which are enough to distribute $1$ candy to each of the $10$ children.

 **Test Case $3$:**  Chef must buy $1$ more packet after which he will have $13$ candies which will be enough to distribute $1$ candy to each of the $10$ children.

 **Test Case $4$:**  Chef must buy $3$ more packets after which he will have $21$ candies which will be enough to distribute $1$ candy to each of the $20$ children.

```py
import math

t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a,b=map(int,input().split())
    h=abs(a-b)
    if a>b:
        print(math.ceil(h/4))
    else:
        print(0)
```
