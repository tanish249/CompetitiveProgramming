## Problem

### Can Chef

Chef owns a car that can run $15$ kilometers using $1$ liter of petrol.
He wants to attend a programming camp at DAIICT.

$X$ liters of petrol is present in Chef's car. The distance between his house and DAIICT is $Y$ kilometers.
Determine whether Chef can attend the event and  **return**  to his home with the given amount of petrol.

 **Note** : Chef has to return back to home, so the total distance to be covered would be $2\cdot Y$.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of two space-separated integers $X$ and $Y$ — the amount of petrol in liter and the distance between Chef's house and DAIICT in kilometers, respectively.
### Output Format

For each test case, print `YES` if it is possible for the chef to attend the event and return home, else, print `NO`.

You may print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example, `Yes`, `yes`, `YES`, and `yES` are all considered identical.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq X, Y \leq 1000$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
10 50
15 200
3 20

```

```
YES
NO
YES
```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Chef needs to cover a distance of $100$ kilometers in total. He can cover it with $10$ liters of petrol.

 **Test case $2$:**  Chef needs to cover a distance of $400$ kilometers in total but using $15$ liters of petrol, he can cover only $225$ kilometers.

 **Test case $3$:**  Chef needs to cover a distance of $40$ kilometers in total. He can cover it with $3$ liters of petrol.

```py
t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a,b=map(int,input().split())
    h=a*15
    g=2*b
    if h>=g:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
    
```
