## Problem

### Summer Heat
### Read problem statements in Vietnamese,

Chefland has $2$ different types of coconut, type $A$ and type $B$. Type $A$ contains only $x_a$ milliliters of coconut water and type $B$ contains only $x_b$ grams of coconut pulp. Chef's nutritionist has advised him to consume $X_a$ milliliters of coconut water and $X_b$ grams of coconut pulp every week in the summer. Find the total number of coconuts (type $A$ + type $B$) that Chef should buy each week to keep himself active in the hot weather.

### Input Format
- The first line contains an integer $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- Each test case contains a single line of input, four integers $x_a$, $x_b$, $X_a$, $X_b$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output in a single line the answer to the problem.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 15000$
- $100 \leq x_a \leq 200$
- $400 \leq x_b \leq 500$
- $1000 \leq X_a \leq 1200$
- $1000 \leq X_b \leq 1500$
- $x_a$ divides $X_a$.
- $x_b$ divides $X_b$.

100 400 1000 1200
100 450 1000 1350
150 400 1200 1200
```

```
13
13
11
```

### Explanation:

 **TestCase $1$:**  Number of coconuts of Type $A$ required = $\frac{1000}{100} = 10$ and number of coconuts of Type $B$ required = $\frac{1200}{400} = 3$. So the total number of coconuts required is $10 + 3 = 13$.

 **TestCase $2$:**  Number of coconuts of Type $A$ required = $\frac{1000}{100} = 10$ and number of coconuts of Type $B$ required = $\frac{1350}{450} = 3$. So the total number of coconuts required is $10 + 3 = 13$.

 **TestCase $3$:**  Number of coconuts of Type $A$ required = $\frac{1200}{150} = 8$ and number of coconuts of Type $B$ required = $\frac{1200}{400} = 3$. So the total number of coconuts required is $8 + 3 = 11$.

for _ in range(t):
    a,b,c,d=map(int,input().split())
    h=c//a
    g=d//b
    print(h+g)
```
