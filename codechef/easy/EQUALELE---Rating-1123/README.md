## Problem

### Equal Elements

You are given an array $A$ of size $N$. In one operation, you can do the following:

- Select indices $i$ and $j$ $(i\neq j)$ and set $A_i = A_j$.

Find the  **minimum**  number of operations required to make all elements of the array  **equal**.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of multiple lines of input. The first line of each test case contains an integer $N$ — the size of the array. The next line contains $N$ space-separated integers, denoting the array $A$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line, the  **minimum**  number of operations required to make all elements of the array  **equal**.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq N \leq 2\cdot 10^5$
- $1 \leq A_i \leq N$
- The sum of $N$ over all test cases won't exceed $2\cdot 10^5$.
### Sample 1:

```
3
3
1 2 3
4
2 2 3 1
4
3 1 2 4

```

```
2
2
3

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  The minimum number of operations required to make all elements of the array equal is $2$. A possible sequence of operations is:

- Select indices $1$ and $2$ and set $A_1 = A_2 = 2$.
- Select indices $3$ and $2$ and set $A_3 = A_2 = 2$.

Thus, the final array is $[2, 2, 2]$.

 **Test case $2$:**  The minimum number of operations required to make all elements of the array equal is $2$. A possible sequence of operations is:

- Select indices $3$ and $2$ and set $A_3 = A_2 = 2$.
- Select indices $4$ and $3$ and set $A_4 = A_3 = 2$.

Thus, the final array is $[2, 2, 2, 2]$.

 **Test case $3$:**  The minimum number of operations required to make all elements of the array equal is $3$. A possible sequence of operations is:

- Select indices $2$ and $1$ and set $A_2 = A_1 = 3$.
- Select indices $3$ and $1$ and set $A_3 = A_1 = 3$.
- Select indices $4$ and $1$ and set $A_4 = A_1 = 3$.

Thus, the final array is $[3, 3, 3, 3]$.

```py
t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a=int(input())
    nums=list(map(int,input().split()))
    h=max(nums,key=nums.count)
    g=nums.count(h)
    f=len(nums)
    print(abs(f-g))
```
