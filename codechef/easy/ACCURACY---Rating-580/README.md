## Problem

### High Accuracy

There are $100$ questions in a paper. Each question carries `+3` marks for correct answer, `-1` marks for incorrect answer and `0` marks for unattempted question.

It is given that Chef received exactly $X$ $(0 \leq X \leq 100)$ marks. Determine the  **minimum**  number of problems Chef marked  **incorrect**.

### Input Format
- First line will contain $T$, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- Each testcase contains of a single integer $X$, marks that Chef received.
### Output Format

For each test case, output the  **minimum**  number of problems Chef marked incorrect.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq X \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
0
100
32

```

```
0
2

0

```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case $1$:**  It might be possible that Chef didn't attempt any question in which case he didn't get any question incorrect.

 **Test Case $2$:**  For the case when Chef got $34$ questions correct and $2$ questions incorrect, Chef marked minimum incorrect questions.

 **Test Case $3$:**  For the case when Chef got $11$ questions correct and $1$ question incorrect, Chef marked minimum incorrect questions.

 **Test Case $4$:**  For the case when Chef got $6$ questions correct and no question incorrect, Chef marked minimum incorrect questions.
