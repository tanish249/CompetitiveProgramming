## Problem

### Donation Rewards

On the occasion of World Blood Donor Day, Chef has organized an event to reward regular blood donars in Chefland.

- If the donor has made less than or equal to $3$ donations, they receive a BRONZE donor badge.
- If the donor has made more than $3$ but less than equal to $6$ donations, they receive a SILVER donor badge.
- If the donor has made more than $6$ donations, they receive a GOLD donor badge.

Given that a person has made $X$ donations, find the badge they receive.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case contains an integer $X$, denoting the number of blood donations the person has made.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line:

- BRONZE, if the person has made less than or equal to $3$ donations;
- SILVER, if the person has made more than $3$ but less than equal to $6$ donations;
- GOLD, if the person has made more than $6$ donations.

Each character can be printed in uppercase or lowercase. For example, `GOLD`, `gold`, `Gold`, and `gOlD` are considered identical.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq X \leq 10$

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  The person has made less than equal to $3$ donations. Thus they receive bronze badge.

 **Test case $2$:**  The person has made less than equal to $3$ donations. Thus they receive bronze badge.

 **Test case $3$:**  The person has made more than $3$ but less than equal to $6$ donations. Thus they receive silver badge.

 **Test case $4$:**  The person has made more than $6$ donations. Thus they receive gold badge.
