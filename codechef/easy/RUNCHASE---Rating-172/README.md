## Problem

### Run Chase

Chef is watching a T20 cricket match.

The team batting first has scored $N$ runs.

The team batting second will bat for $20$ overs. To win the match, they must score  **strictly**  more than $N$ runs.

Find the smallest integer run rate $R$, in runs per over, such that scoring $R$ runs in each of the $20$ overs is enough to win the match.

### Input Format
- The only line of input contains a single integer $N$ — the number of runs scored by the team batting first.
### Output Format

Output a single integer $R$ — the smallest integer run rate to win the match.

### Constraints
- $50 \leq N \leq 300$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
155
```

```
8
```

### Explanation:

If the second team scores at a run rate of $7$, they score $20 \cdot 7 = 140$ runs, which is not enough. At a run rate of $8$, they score $20 \cdot 8 = 160$ runs, which is strictly more than $155$. So the answer is $8$.

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
200
```

```
11
```

### Explanation:

If the second team scores at a run rate of $10$, they score $20 \cdot 10 = 200$ runs, which only ties the score. They need to score strictly more than $200$, so the answer is $11$.
