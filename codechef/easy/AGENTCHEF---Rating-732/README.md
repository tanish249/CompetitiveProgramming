## Problem

### Selling Insurance

Chef has started a new job as an insurance agent.
Each insurance costs $X$ dollars and Chef gets a $20 \%$ commission on selling each insurance.

Find the  **minimum**  number of insurances Chef needs to sell to earn  **at least**  $100$ dollars.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single integer $X$, the cost of an insurance.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line, the  **minimum**  number of insurances Chef needs to sell to earn  **at least**  $100$ dollars.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq X \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
20
80
1
5

```

```
25
7
500
100

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  On selling $1$ insurance, Chef earns $20 \%$ of $20$, which is, $4$ dollars. This means that Chef needs to sell $25$ insurances to earn $25\cdot 4 = 100$ dollars.

 **Test case $2$:**  On selling $1$ insurance, Chef earns $20 \%$ of $80$, which is, $16$ dollars.
On selling $6$ insurances, Chef will earn $16\cdot 6 = 96$ dollars. Thus, he would need to sell a minimum of $7$ insurances to earn at least $100$ dollars.

 **Test case $3$:**  On selling $1$ insurance, Chef earns $20 \%$ of $1$, which is, $0.2$ dollars. This means that Chef needs to sell $500$ insurances to earn $500\cdot 0.2 = 100$ dollars.

 **Test case $4$:**  On selling $1$ insurance, Chef earns $20 \%$ of $5$, which is, $1$ dollars. This means that Chef needs to sell $100$ insurances to earn $100\cdot 1 = 100$ dollars.

for _ in range(t):
    a=int(input())
    h=(a*(20/100))
    print(math.ceil(100/h))
```
