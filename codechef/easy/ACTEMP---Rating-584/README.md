## Problem

### Air Conditioner Temperature

There are three people sitting in a room - Alice, Bob, and Charlie. They need to decide on the temperature to set on the air conditioner. Everyone has a demand each:

- Alice wants the temperature to be at least $A$ degrees.
- Bob wants the temperature to be at most $B$ degrees.
- Charlie wants the temperature to be at least $C$ degrees.

Can they all agree on some temperature, or not?

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single line which contains three integers - $A, B, C$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line, "Yes" or "No". "Yes", if they can decide on some temperature which fits all their demands. Or "No", if no temperature fits all their demands.

You may print each character of the string in either uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings `NO`, `nO`, `No`, and `no` will all be treated as identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq A, B, C \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
30 35 25
30 35 40
30 35 35
30 25 35

```

```
Yes
No
Yes
No

```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case 1:**  Alice wants the temperature to be $\ge 30$, Bob wants it to be $\le 35$, and Charlie wants it to be $\ge 25$. The temperatures $30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35$ all satisfy all their demands. So they can choose any of these 6 temperatures, and so the answer is "Yes".

 **Test Case 2:**  Alice wants the temperature to be $\ge 30$, Bob wants it to be $\le 35$, and Charlie wants it to be $\ge 40$. A number can't be both $\ge 40$, and $\le 35$. So there is no temperature that satisfies all their demands. So the answer is "No".

 **Test Case 3:**  Alice wants the temperature to be $\ge 30$, Bob wants it to be $\le 35$, and Charlie wants it to be $\ge 35$. The temperature $35$ satisfies all their demands. So the answer is "Yes".

 **Test Case 4:**  Alice wants the temperature to be $\ge 30$, Bob wants it to be $\le 25$, and Charlie wants it to be $\ge 35$. A number can't be both $\ge 30$, and $\le 25$. So there is no temperature that satisfies all their demands. So the answer is "No".

```py
t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a,b,c=map(int,input().split())
    if b>=a and b>=c:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
```
