## Problem

### Problem

*One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya*

Alice and Bob are competing in a challenge. Initially Alice has $N$ problems and Bob has $M$ problems.

- Each time Alice solves a problem, Bob receives one more problem to solve.
- Each time Bob solves a problem, Alice receives three more problems to solve.

Find whether it is possible that both of them have the  **same**  number of problems left if they can solve the problems in any arbitrary manner.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$ — the initial number of problems of Alice and Bob respectively.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line, `YES`, it is possible that both of them have the  **same**  number of problems left if they can solve the problems in any arbitrary manner and `NO` otherwise.

Each character of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase. That is, the strings `NO`, `no`, `nO`, and `No` will be treated as equivalent.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq N, M \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
4 2
1 5
2 3
2 2

```

```
YES
YES
NO
YES

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Initially Alice has $4$ problems while Bob has $2$ problems.
Alice can solve a problem first. Thus, Alice now has $4-1 = 3$ problems left and Bob has $2 + 1 = 3$ problems left.

Thus, both of them can have same number of problems left.

 **Test case $2$:**  Initially Alice has $1$ problem while Bob has $5$ problems.
Bob can solve a problem first. Thus, Bob now has $5-1 = 4$ problems left and Alice has $1 + 3 = 4$ problems left.

Thus, both of them can have same number of problems left.

 **Test case $3$:**  It can be proven that they cannot have the same number of problems left.

 **Test case $4$:**  Both of them have the same number of problems initially.

```py
# cook your dish here
T = int(input())
for i in range(T):
    N,M=map(int,input().split())
    h=abs(N-M)
    if h%2==0:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
```
