## Problem

### Presents for Cheffina

Chef has fallen in love with Cheffina, and wants to buy $N$ gifts for her. On reaching the gift shop, Chef got to know the following two things:

- The cost of each gift is $1$ coin.
- On the purchase of every $4^{th}$ gift, Chef gets the $5^{th}$ gift free of cost.

What is the minimum number of coins that Chef will require in order to come out of the shop carrying $N$ gifts?

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain an integer $T$ — the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains an integer $N$, the number of gifts in the shop.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the minimum number of coins that Chef will require to obtain all $N$ gifts.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^9$
### Sample 1:

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$** : After purchasing $4$ gifts, Chef will get the $5^{th}$ gift free of cost. Hence Chef only requires $4$ coins in order to get $5$ gifts.

 **Test case $2$** : Chef will require $4$ coins in order to get $4$ gifts.

for _ in range(t):
    a=int(input())
    h=a//5
    if a%5==0:
        print(abs(a-h))
    else:
        print(a)
```
