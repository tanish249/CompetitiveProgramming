## Problem

### Building Race

Two friends Chef and Chefina are currently on floors $A$ and $B$ respectively. They hear an announcement that prizes are being distributed on the ground floor and so decide to reach the ground floor as soon as possible.

Chef can climb down $X$ floors per minute while Chefina can climb down $Y$ floors per minute. Determine who will reach the ground floor first (ie. floor number 0). In case both reach the ground floor together, print `Both`.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers $A$, $B$, $X$, and $Y$ — the current floor of Chef, the current floor of Chefina, speed of Chef and speed of Chefina in floors per minute respectively.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line:

- Chef if Chef reaches the ground floor first.
- Chefina if she reaches the ground floor first.
- Both if both reach the ground floor at the same time.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings `CHEF`, `chef`, `Chef`, and `chEF` are all considered the same.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 2500$
- $1 \leq A, B \leq 100$
- $1 \leq X, Y \leq 10$
### Sample 1:

Output

```
4
2 2 2 2
4 2 1 5
3 2 4 1
3 2 2 1

```

```
Both
Chefina
Chef
Chef
```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Chef is on the second floor and has a speed of $2$ floors per minute. Thus, Chef takes $1$ minute to reach the ground floor. Chefina is on the second floor and and has a speed of $2$ floors per minute. Thus, Chefina takes $1$ minute to reach the ground floor. Both Chef and Chefina reach the ground floor at the same time.

 **Test case $2$:**  Chef is on the fourth floor and has a speed of $1$ floor per minute. Thus, Chef takes $4$ minute to reach the ground floor. Chefina is on the second floor and and has a speed of $5$ floors per minute. Thus, Chefina takes $0.4$ minutes to reach the ground floor. Chefina reaches the ground floor first.

 **Test case $3$:**  Chef is on the third floor and has a speed of $4$ floors per minute. Thus, Chef takes $0.75$ minutes to reach the ground floor. Chefina is on the second floor and and has a speed of $1$ floor per minute. Thus, Chefina takes $2$ minutes to reach the ground floor. Chef reaches the ground floor first.

 **Test case $4$:**  Chef is on the third floor and has a speed of $2$ floors per minute. Thus, Chef takes $1.5$ minutes to reach the ground floor. Chefina is on the second floor and and has a speed of $1$ floor per minute. Thus, Chefina takes $2$ minutes to reach the ground floor. Chef reaches the ground floor first.

for _ in range(t):
    a,b,c,d=map(int,input().split())
    h=a/c
    g=b/d
    if h>g:
        print("CHEFINA")
    elif g>h:
        print("chef")
    else:
        print("both")
```
