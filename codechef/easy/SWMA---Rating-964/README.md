## Problem

### Swapping Marks Digits

Alice scored $A$ marks and Bob scored $B$ marks in an exam. Both $A$ and $B$ are two-digit numbers that don't contain the digit $0$.

Alice wants her marks to display higher than Bob's.
For this, she can reverse her score and/or Bob's score.

Is there a way for her score to display higher than Bob's?

For example, if $A = 37$ and $B = 83$, Alice can reverse her score to make it $73$, and also reverse Bob's score to make it $38$, and now her score is higher.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $A$ and $B$ — the marks obtained by Alice and Bob, respectively.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the answer: `"Yes"` if Alice can change her score to display higher than Bob's, and `"No"` otherwise (without quotes).

Each letter of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase, i.e, the strings `No`, `no`, `NO`, and `nO` will all be treated as equivalent.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^4$
- $11 \leq A, B \lt 100$
- $A$ and $B$ don't contain $0$ in their decimal representation.
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
5
14 41
45 53
58 86
54 82
12 34

```

```
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
No
```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Alice can reverse her score to get $41$, and also reverse Bob's score to make it $14$.

 **Test case $2$:**  Alice can reverse her score to get $54$, and leave Bob's score unchanged.

 **Test case $3$:**  Alice can reverse her score to get $85$, and also reverse Bob's score to make it $68$.

 **Test case $4$:**  Alice can leave her score unchanged, and reverse Bob's score to make it $28$.

 **Test case $5$:**  No matter what Alice does, her score cannot exceed Bob's.

```py
t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a,b=input().split()
    h=str(a)[::-1]
    g=str(b)[::-1]
    if h>b or a>g or a>b or h>g:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print("NO")
```
