## Problem

### Odd Sum Pair

Chef has $3$ numbers: $A$, $B$, and $C$.

Chef wonders if it is possible to choose  **exactly**  two numbers out of the three numbers such that their sum is  **odd**. Your task is to help Chef determine if such a pair exists.

## Function Declaration
### Function Name

$checkOddPairs$ – This function checks if any two numbers out of the three can form an odd sum.

### Parameters
- $A$ : an integer representing the first number.
- $B$ : an integer representing the second number.
- $C$ : an integer representing the third number.
### Return Value

Returns a string: `"YES"` if it is possible to choose two numbers with an odd sum, otherwise returns `"NO"`.

### Constraints:
- $1 \le A, B, C \le 10^9$

 *The input and output formats provided below are only for testing with custom inputs. You only need to complete the core logic function.* 

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of three space-separated integers: $A$, $B$, and $C$.
### Output Format
- For each test case, output YES if you can choose exactly two numbers with odd sum, NO otherwise.
- The output is case-insensitive. Thus, the strings YES, yes, yeS, and Yes are all considered the same.
### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq A, B, C \leq 10$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
1 2 3
8 4 6
3 3 9
7 8 6

```

```
YES
NO
NO
YES

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case 1:**  Chef can choose $2$ and $3$ since $2 + 3 = 5$ and $5$ is odd.

 **Test case 2:**  It can be shown that Chef cannot choose two numbers among $8$, $4$ and $6$ with odd sum.

class Solution:
    def check_odd_pairs(self, A, B, C):
        h = A + B
        g = B + C
        f = A + C

        if h % 2 != 0 or g % 2 != 0 or f % 2 != 0:
            return "YES"
        else:
            return "NO"
```
