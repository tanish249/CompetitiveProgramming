## Problem

### The Mango Truck

You are given that a mango weighs $X$ kilograms and a truck weighs $Y$ kilograms. You want to cross a bridge that can withstand a weight of $Z$ kilograms.

Find the  **maximum**  number of mangoes you can load in the truck so that you can cross the bridge safely.

### Input Format
- First line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- Each test case consists of a single line of input, three integers $X, Y, Z$ - the weight of mango, the weight of truck and the weight the bridge can withstand respectively.
### Output Format

For each test case, output in a single line the  **maximum**  number of mangoes that you can load in the truck.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq X \leq Y \leq Z \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
2 5 11
4 10 20
1 1 1
6 40 90

```

```
3
2
0
8

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  You can load $3$ mangoes at maximum. The total weight is $3\times 2+5 = 11 \leq 11$. Thus, the truck can safely cross the bridge with $3$ mangoes. If you load $4$ mangoes, the total weight is $4\times 2+5 = 13 \gt 11$.

 **Test case $2$:**  You can load $2$ mangoes at maximum. The total weight is $2\times 4+10 = 18 \leq 20$. Thus, the truck can safely cross the bridge with $2$ mangoes.

 **Test case $3$:**  You can load $0$ mangoes at maximum. The total weight is $0\times 1+1 = 1 \leq 1$. Thus, the truck can safely cross the bridge only if there are $0$ mangoes.

 **Test case $4$:**  You can load $8$ mangoes at maximum. The total weight is $6\times 8+40 = 88 \leq 90$. Thus, the truck can safely cross the bridge with $8$ mangoes.

```py
t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a,b,c=map(int,input().split())
    h=abs(c-b)
    print(h//a)
```
