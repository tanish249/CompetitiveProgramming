## Problem

### Enormous Input Test

You are given $N$ integers. Find the count of numbers divisible by $K$.

### Input Format

The input begins with two positive integers $N$, $K$. The next $N$ lines contains one positive integer each denoted by $A_i$.

### Output Format

Output a single number denoting how many integers are divisible by $K$.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq N, K \leq 10^7$
- $1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
7 3
1
51
966369
7
9
999996
11

```

```
4
```

### Explanation:

The integers divisible by $3$ are $51, 966369, 9,$ and $999996$. Thus, there are $4$ integers in total.
