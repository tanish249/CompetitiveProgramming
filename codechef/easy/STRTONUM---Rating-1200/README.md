## Problem

### Convert string to number

You are given a string that represents a positive number. Your task is to write a program that converts this string into its numerical equivalent without using any in-built parsing, conversion libraries, or direct type casting methods. The string will not contain any leading zeros, decimals, or any non-numeric characters.

Complete the function  **stringToNumber**  in the IDE

### Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer, T, the number of test cases.
- The following T lines each contain a single string, S, representing the number.
### Output Format

For each test case, print the numerical equivalent of the string.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq |S| \leq 10$, where $|S|$ is the length of the string.
- S will only contain digits (0-9) and will not have leading zeros.
