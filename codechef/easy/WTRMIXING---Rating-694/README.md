## Problem

### Water Mixing

Chef is setting up a perfect bath for himself. He has $X$ litres of hot water and $Y$ litres of cold water.
The initial temperature of water in his bathtub is $A$ degrees. On mixing water, the temperature of the bathtub changes as following:

- The temperature rises by $1$ degree on mixing $1$ litre of hot water.
- The temperature drops by $1$ degree on mixing $1$ litre of cold water.

Determine whether he can set the temperature to $B$ degrees for a perfect bath.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of four space-separated integers $A, B, X,$ and $Y$ — the initial temperature of bathtub, the desired temperature of bathtub, the amount of hot water in litres, and the amount of cold water in litres respectively.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line, `YES` if Chef can get the desired temperature for his bath, and `NO` otherwise.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings `YES`, `yEs`, `yes`, and `yeS` will all be treated as identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 2000$
- $20 \leq A, B \leq 40$
- $0 \leq X, Y \leq 20$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
24 25 2 0
37 37 2 9
30 20 10 9
30 31 0 20

```

```
YES
YES
NO
NO

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  The initial temperature of water is $24$ and the desired temperature is $25$. Chef has $2$ litres of hot water. He can add $1$ litre hot water in the tub and change the temperature to $24+1=25$ degrees.

 **Test case $2$:**  The initial temperature of water is $37$ and the desired temperature is also $37$. Thus, Chef does not need to add any more water in the bathtub.

 **Test case $3$:**  The initial temperature of water is $30$ and the desired temperature is $20$. Chef needs to add $10$ litres of cold water to reach the desired temperature. Since he only has $9$ litres of cold water, he cannot reach the desired temperature.

 **Test case $4$:**  The initial temperature of water is $30$ and the desired temperature is $31$. Chef needs to add $1$ litre of hot water to reach the desired temperature. Since he has no hot water, he cannot reach the desired temperature.

```py
t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a,b,c,d=map(int,input().split())
    h=abs(a-b)
    if a==b:
        print('YES')
    elif b>a and c>=h:
        print('YES')
    elif a>b and d>=h:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```
