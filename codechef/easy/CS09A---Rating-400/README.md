# CS09A - Rating 400

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

### Debug this code - Advance

The code in the IDE is incorrect - debug the code to solve this problem!

Chef's current rating is $X$, and he wants to improve it.
It is generally recommended that a person with rating $X$ should solve problems whose difficulty lies in the range $[X, X+200]$, i.e, problems whose difficulty is at least $X$ and at most $X+200$.
You find out that Chef is currently solving problems with a difficulty of $Y$.
Is Chef following the recommended practice or not?

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
- Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing two space-separated integers $X, Y$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line '`YES`' if Chef is following the recommended practice style, and '`NO`' otherwise.

### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
2
1300 1500
1201 1402

```

```
YES
NO

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Chef's current rating is $1300$, so he should solve problems with difficulty lying in $[1300,1500]$. Since $1500$ lies in $[1300,1500]$, Chef is doing his practice in a recommended way :)

 **Test case $2$:**  Chef's current rating is $1201$, so he should solve problems with difficulty lying in $[1201,1401]$. Since $1402$ does not lie in $[1201,1401]$, Chef is not doing his practice in a recommended way :(

t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    X, Y = map(int,input().split())
    if Y>=X and Y<=(X+200):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
