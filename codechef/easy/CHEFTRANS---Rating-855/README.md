## Problem

### Chef and Vacation Transportation

Vacations have arrived and Chef wants to go to his home in ChefLand. There are two types of routes he can take:

- Take a flight from his college to ChefArina which takes $X$ minutes and then take a bus from ChefArina to ChefLand which takes $Y$ minutes.
- Take a direct train from his college to ChefLand which takes $Z$ minutes.

Which of these two options is faster?

### Input Format
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.
- The first line of the test case contains three space-separated integers $X$, $Y$, and $Z$.
### Output Format

For each test case, if Chef takes the train output `TRAIN`, if Chef takes the plane and the bus output `PLANEBUS`, if both are equal output `EQUAL`.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings `train`, `tRAiN`, `TrAin`, and `TRAIN` will all be treated as identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq X,Y,Z \leq 10^9$
### Subtasks
- Subtask $1$ (100 points): Original constraints
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
10 12 11
3 5 15
9 4 13

```

```
TRAIN
PLANEBUS
EQUAL

```

### Explanation:
- Test Case $1$: It will take $10 + 12 = 22$ minutes to travel using Plane and Bus. The train journey takes $11$ minutes. Since the train is faster, Chef will choose the train.
- Test Case $2$: It will take $3 + 5 = 8$ minutes to travel using Plane and Bus. The train journey takes $15$ minutes. Since the plane and bus are faster, Chef will choose the plane and bus.
- Test Case $3$: It will take $9 + 4 = 13$ minutes to travel using Plane and Bus. The train journey takes $13$ minutes. Since they both are equal, Chef can choose either.

```py
t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a,b,c=map(int,input().split())
    h=a+b
    if h==c:
        print("EQUAL")
    elif h>c:
        print('TRAIN')
    else:
        print("PLANEBUS")
```
