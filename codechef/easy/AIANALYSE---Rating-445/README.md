## Problem

### AI Analysing Code

 *Chef has recently introduced a feature which allows you to open any user’s submitted code (not just your own), and ask an AI to explain that code in English. For example, you can go to https://www.codechef.com/viewsolution/70530506 and click on "Analyse This Code".* 

But there is a restriction that the feature works only on codes which are at most $1000$ characters long. Given the number of characters, $C$, in a particular code, output whether the feature is available on this code or not.

### Input Format

The only line of input will contain a single integer $C$, denoting the number of characters in the code.

### Output Format

Output a single line which contains either "Yes", if the feature is available on this code, or "No", if not.

You may print each character of the string in either uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings `NO`, `nO`, `No`, and `no` will all be treated as identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq C \leq 10000$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
50

```

```
Yes
```

### Explanation:

The code's length is only $50$, and $50 \le 1000$. So, the feature is available, and the answer is "Yes".

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
1000

```

```
Yes
```

### Explanation:

The code's length is $1000$, and $1000 \le 1000$. So, the feature is available, and the answer is "Yes".

### Sample 3:
Input
Output

```
1001

```

```
No
```

### Explanation:

The code's length is $1001$, and $1001 \nleq 1000$. So, the feature is not available, and the answer is "No".

```py
a=int(input())
if 1000>=a:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```
