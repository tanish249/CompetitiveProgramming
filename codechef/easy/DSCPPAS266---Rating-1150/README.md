## Problem

### Reduce to Single Element Array

You are given an array $arr$ of $N$ positive integers. In each move, you can pick two different numbers from the array where their absolute difference is at most one, and remove the smaller one. If two numbers are the same, you can remove either. Your goal is to determine if you can reduce the array to exactly one number using these moves.

## Function Declaration
### Function Name

$canReduce$ – This function determines whether the array can be reduced to just one number based on the given rules.

### Parameters

$N$ : An integer representing the size of the array.
$arr$ : An array of integers representing the given sequence.

### Return Value

Returns a boolean: $true$ if the array can be reduced to a single number, and $false$ otherwise.

### Constraints:

$1 \le N \le 10^4$
$1 \le arr[i] \le 10^4$

 *The input and output formats provided below are only for testing with custom inputs. You only need to return the value. Printing is handled automatically.* 

### Input Format
- The first line contains an integer $N$ representing the size of $arr$.
- Next lines contain $N$ integers that are present in $arr$.
### Output Format
- Output "YES" if it's possible to reduce the array to one element, otherwise "NO".
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
4 1 3 2
```

```
YES
```

### Explanation:

First of all pick elements 1 and 2 and remove 1 as it is smallest. Now pick 2 and 3 and remove 2 as it is smallest,then pick 3 and 4 and remove 3, now a single element is left so answer is YES.

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
3
1 3 4
```

```
NO
```

### Explanation:

There is no way to reduce the array to a single element.

```py
def canReduce(N: int, arr: list[int]) -> bool:
    h=len(arr)
    if h%2==0:
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"
```
