## Problem

### Too many Floors

Chef and Chefina are residing in a hotel.

There are $10$ floors in the hotel and each floor consists of $10$ rooms.

- Floor $1$ consists of room numbers $1$ to $10$.
- Floor $2$ consists of room numbers $11$ to $20$. $\ldots$
- Floor $i$ consists of room numbers $10 \cdot (i-1) + 1$ to $10 \cdot i$.

You know that Chef's room number is $X$ while Chefina's Room number is $Y$.
If Chef starts from his room, find the number of floors he needs to travel to reach Chefina's room.

### Input Format
- First line will contain $T$, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- Each test case contains of a single line of input, two integers $X, Y$, the room numbers of Chef and Chefina respectively.
### Output Format

For each test case, output the number of floors Chef needs to travel to reach Chefina's room.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq X, Y \leq 100$
- $X \neq Y$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
1 100
42 50
53 30
81 80

```

```
9
0
3
1

```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case $1$:**  Since Room $1$ is on $1^{st}$ floor and Room $100$ is on $10^{th}$ floor, Chef needs to climb $9$ floors to reach Chefina's Room.

 **Test Case $2$:**  Since Room $42$ is on $5^{th}$ floor and Room $50$ is also on $5^{th}$ floor, Chef does not need to climb any floor.

 **Test Case $3$:**  Since Room $53$ is on $6^{th}$ floor and Room $30$ is on $3^{rd}$ floor, Chef needs to go down $3$ floors to reach Chefina's Room.

 **Test Case $4$:**  Since Room $81$ is on $9^{th}$ floor and Room $80$ is on $8^{th}$ floor, Chef needs to go down $1$ floors to reach Chefina's Room.

```py
import math 

t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a,b=map(int,input().split())
    h=math.ceil(a/10)
    g=math.ceil(b/10)
    print(abs(h-g))
```
