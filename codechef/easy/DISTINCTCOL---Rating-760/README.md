## Problem

### Distinct Colors

There are $N$ different types of colours numbered from $1$ to $N$. Chef has $A_i$ balls having colour $i$, $(1\le i \le N)$.

Chef will arrange some boxes and put each ball in  **exactly one**  of those boxes.
Find the  **minimum**  number of boxes Chef needs so that  **no**  box contains  **two**  balls of same colour.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$, denoting the number of colors.
- The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ — denoting the number of balls having colour $i$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output the  **minimum**  number of boxes required so that no box contains two balls of same colour.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$
- $1 \leq A_i \leq 10^5$

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Chef needs at least $8$ boxes such that no box has two balls of same colour. A possible configuration of the $8$ boxes would be $\{[1, 2], [1, 2], [1, 2], [1, 2], [1, 2], [1], [1], [1]\}$ where the $i^{th}$ element of this set denotes the colour of balls in the $i^{th}$ box.

 **Test case $2$:**  Chef needs at least $15$ boxes such that no box has two balls of same colour.

 **Test case $3$:**  Chef needs at least $4$ boxes such that no box has two balls of same colour. A possible configuration of the $4$ boxes would be $\{[1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]\}$ where the $i^{th}$ element of this set denotes the colour of balls in the $i^{th}$ box.

for _ in range(t):
    a=int(input())
    nums=list(map(int,input().split()))
    print(max(nums))
```
