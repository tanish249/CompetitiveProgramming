## Problem

### Comparison operators

Usual  **Comparison operators**  used within conditional statements are

- Equals: a == b
- Not Equals: a != b
- Less than: a < b
- Less than or equal to: a <= b
- Greater than: a > b
- Greater than or equal to: a >= b
### Task

Write a program which does the following

- Accepts the count of test cases - $t$ Each test case has one integer $N$
- Output the following for each test case on separate lines If input is exactly divisible by $3$, output 'Divisible by 3'. Else output 'Not divisible by 3'. If the input is odd, output 'Odd'. Else output 'Even'.
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
3
4
5
6
```

```
Divisible by 3
Odd
Not divisible by 3
Even
Not divisible by 3
Odd
Divisible by 3
Even
```

### Explanation:

 **Test case 1:**  $3$ is divisible by 3 and is odd as well
 **Test case 2:**  $4$ is not divisible by 3. However, $4$ is even.

```py
# Update the '_' below to solve the problem

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    
    # Condition 1
    if n%3==0:
        print('Divisible by 3')
    else:
        print('Not divisible by 3')
    
    #Condition 2
    if n%2==0:
        print('Even')
    else:
        print('Odd')
```
