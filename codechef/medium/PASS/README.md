## Problem

### Pass

Chef took $5$ exams in a series, each of which were scored out of $100$.

Chef is awarded a pass certificate if  **both**  the following conditions are satisfied:

- He attains a score of at least $60$ on at least $2$ exams.
- He attains a score of at least $30$ on at least $4$ exams.

Print $\text{Pass}$ or $\text{Fail}$ based on whether Chef will pass or fail.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- The first and only line of input contains $5$ integers - $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_5$, where $A_i$ is his score in the $i$-th exam.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line $\text{Pass}$ or $\text{Fail}$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $0 \le A_i \le 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
95 98 100 96 99
32 60 30 65 23
50 50 50 50 50
90 90 29 15 90

```

```
Pass
Pass
Fail
Fail
```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case 1:**  Chef was above $90$ in each exam so he easily cleared all the criteria.

 **Test Case 2:**  Chef has exactly $2$ exams at least $60$ or more (the $65$ and $60$), and exactly $4$ exams at least $30$ or more (the $65$, $60$, $32$ and $30$). Hence, he barely clears the criteria.

 **Test Case 3:**  Chef does not have $2$ exams with at least $60$ score, so he fails.

```py
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    nums.sort()

    if nums[0] >= 60 and nums[1] >= 60:
        print("PASS")
    elif nums[0] >= 30 and nums[1] >= 30 and nums[2] >= 30 and nums[3] >= 30:
        print("PASS")
    else:
        print("FAIL")
```
