## Problem

### Bank Account Validator

You are given $T$ account numbers. For each test case, the account number is represented by an integer $A$.

An account number is considered  **valid**  if the sum of all its digits is divisible by $10$. Otherwise, it is considered  **invalid**.

For example, for the account number $12340$, the sum of its digits is:

$1+2+3+4+0=10$

Since $10$ is divisible by $10$, the account number is valid.

For each account number, determine whether it is  **valid**.

### Input Format

The first line contains an integer $T$ — the number of test cases.

Each of the next $T$ lines contains an integer $A$ — the account number.

### Output Format

For each test case, print `Valid` if the account number is valid.

Otherwise, print `Invalid`.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 1000$
- $1 \le A \le 10^{18}$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
12340
987654321
1111111111
```

```
Valid
Invalid
Valid
```

### Explanation:

For the first account number, the digit sum is $10$, which is divisible by $10$. Therefore, it is `Valid`.

For the second account number, the digit sum is $45$, which is not divisible by $10$. Therefore, it is `Invalid`.

For the third account number, the digit sum is $10$, which is divisible by $10$. Therefore, it is `Valid`.

```py
t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n=int(input())
    h=list(map(int,str(n)))
    if sum(h)%10==0:
        print("Valid")
    else:
        print("Invalid")
```
