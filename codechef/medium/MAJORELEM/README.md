## Problem

### Find the majority element

You are given an array $arr$ containing $n$ integers. Your task is to return the  **majority element**.

A majority element is defined as the element that occurs  **more than $⌊n / 2⌋$ times**. It is guaranteed that such an element always exists.

$⌊n / 2⌋$ => The floor value means if 5 divided by 2 equals 2.5, we’ll choose 2 as the output because of the floor function. 

### Follow-up:

Can you solve this problem in  **O(n)**  time complexity while using only  **O(1) extra space** ?

## Function Declaration
### Function Name

$majorityElement$ – Finds the element that appears more than $⌊n / 2⌋$ times in the array.

### Parameters
- $arr$ : A list/array of integers of size $n$.
### Return Value
- Returns an integer — the majority element that appears more than half the time in the array.
## Constraints:
- $1 \leq T \leq 50,000$
- $n == arr.length$
- $1 \leq n \leq 50,000$
- $-10^9 \leq arr[i] \leq 10^9$
### Input Format
- $T$ → number of test cases
- For each test case: Line 1 → $n$ (array size) Line 2 → n integers representing the array
### Output Format

One value per test case.
