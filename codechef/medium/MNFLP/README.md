## Problem

### Minimum Flips

You are given an array $A$ of length $N$, where each element is either `1` or `-1`.

In one operation, you may choose any index $i$ and change $A_i$ to $-A_i$.

Find the  **minimum number of operations**  required to make the sum of the array equal to `0`.

If it is impossible, print `-1`.

### Input Format
- First line will contain $T$, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- First line of each test case consists of a single integer $N$ denoting the length of the array.
- Second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_N$ denoting the array $A$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output the minimum number of operations to make the sum of the array equal to $0$. Output `-1` if it is not possible to make the sum equal to $0$.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $2 \leq N \leq 1000$
- $A_i = 1$ or $A_i = -1$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
6
1 1 -1 1 -1 -1
8
1 1 1 1 1 -1 -1 -1
7
1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 1
```

```
0
1
-1
```

### Explanation:

For the first test case, the sum is already `0`, so no operation is required.

For the second test case, changing one `1` to `-1` makes the sum `0`, so the answer is `1`.

For the third test case, its sum cannot be made `0`. Therefore, the answer is `-1`.

```py
t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a=int(input())
    nums=list(map(int,input().split()))
    h=sum(nums)
    if h==0:
        print(0)
    elif h%2==0:
        print(abs(h)//2)
    else:
        print(-1)
```
