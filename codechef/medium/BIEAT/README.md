## Problem

### Bit Eater

You are given an array $A$ of $N$ non-negative integers and an integer $M$.

For each element, remove its $M$  **least significant bits**  from its binary representation. This is equivalent to replacing $A_i$ with $\left\lfloor \frac{A_i}{2^M} \right\rfloor$.

If all bits of a number are removed, its resulting value becomes $0$.

Print the resulting array after applying this operation to every element.

### Input Format

The first line contains an integer $N$ — the size of the array.

The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_N$.

The third line contains an integer $M$ — the number of least significant bits to remove.

### Output Format

Print $N$ space-separated integers representing the array after removing the $M$ least significant bits from every element.

### Constraints
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $0 \le A_i \le 10^9$
- $0 \le M \le 30$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
5
12 25 7 32 1
1
```

```
6 12 3 16 0
```

### Explanation:

Removing $1$ least significant bit from each number gives:

$12 \rightarrow 6,\ 25 \rightarrow 12,\ 7 \rightarrow 3,\ 32 \rightarrow 16,\ 1 \rightarrow 0$

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
4
15 8 3 0
4
```

```
0 0 0 0
```

### Explanation:

Each number has at most $4$ significant bits, so removing $4$ least significant bits makes every resulting value $0$.
