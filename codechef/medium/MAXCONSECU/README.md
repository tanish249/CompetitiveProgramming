## Problem

### Chef and Consecutive Ones

Chef has a binary array $nums$ containing only $0$s and $1$s.
He wants to find the maximum number of consecutive $1$s in the array regardless of how many such streaks exist. Can you help Chef determine this?

## Function Declaration
### Function Name

$findMaxConsecutiveOnes$ - This function computes the maximum length of a contiguous segment of `1`s in a binary array.

### Parameters
- $nums$: A binary array of integers where each element is either 0 or 1.
### Return Value
- Returns a single integer representing the maximum number of consecutive 1s in the array.
## Constraints
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$
- $nums[i] \in {0, 1}$
### Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer $N$ — the size of the array.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers representing the binary array $nums$.
### Output Format
- Print a single integer — the maximum number of consecutive 1s in the array.
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
5
0 1 1 0 1

```

```
2

```

### Explanation:

The two `1`s at positions 2 and 3 are consecutive, so the maximum streak is `2`.

def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(nums):
    count=0
    max_count=0
    for i in nums:
        if i==1:
           count +=1
           max_count=max(max_count,count)
        else:
            count=0
    return max_count
    
```
